        "news_article": """With polls showing Liberal Leader Mark Carney is the front-runner in this federal election, the other three main party leaders on stage for Thursday's English-language debate spent much of the contest trying to tear him down.Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre took aim at Carney early on in the high-stakes debate, saying his government would not be all that different from the one led by his unpopular predecessor, former prime minister Justin Trudeau. He urged voters to make a change.NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was chippy throughout the debate, frequently interrupting Poilievre and Carney as he jockeys to get noticed while polls suggest support for his party has cratered. He spent much of his time trying to paint Carney as an out-of-touch elite who will cut public services.Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet was on a similar message track, accusing Carney of being a corporate bigwig who won't stand up for Quebec's interests.Carney held his own in the face of the onslaught, trying to portray himself as the adult in the room who is best placed to help steer Canada through a period of tremendous upheaval with its once-solid relationship with the U.S. in tatters and the economy on shaky ground."Mark Carney is asking for a fourth Liberal term. Are you prepared to elect the same Liberal MPs, the same Liberal ministers, the same Liberal staffers all over again for a fourth term?" Poilievre said.‘I do my own talking points,’ says Carney Carney took Poilievre on, saying the Conservative leader is trying to paint him as Trudeau 2.0 and it's just not true — he will be laser-focused on the economy and producing results on the issues that matter most to Canadians after years of inaction on some big files."It may be difficult for Mr. Poilievre. You spent years running against Justin Trudeau and the carbon tax and they are both gone," Carney said. "I am a very different person than Justin Trudeau. I am focused on results."As for the claim he is taking direction from Trudeau's people, Carney said with a smile: "Look, I do my own talking points thank you very much."Carney said Canada is facing the greatest crisis of our lifetimes with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening the country's economy and its very existence and he jumped into politics now because he has what it takes to the lead the country through the "Trump crisis" and this perilous moment.He said that only weeks into his tenure as prime minister, he has already crafted an agreement with the provinces to break down decades-old internal trade barriers that have long held back domestic free trade by Canada Day.He said Canada's retaliatory tariffs are hitting the Americans where it hurts and he is poised to sit down with Trump to hash out a new bilateral agreement after this election."We can give ourselves far more than Donald Trump can take away," Carney said. "The biggest risk we have to face is Donald Trump. We've got to get that right."Poilievre returned to the theme of Carney being a Trudeau repeat throughout the debate and, in a particularly dramatic moment, he asked the current Liberal leader at one point to apologize to Canadians for the inflation they experienced in the post-COVID period.Carney said he wasn't in the last government, he briefly served as an economic adviser on a part-time basis and he didn't advise the Liberals to do any of the things that fuelled the cost-of-living crisis. He said he's already cut the last government's carbon tax and he has a plan to build many more homes than they did, which would help with affordability issues."The way you judge someone is how how they act," Carney said. "When I was governor of the Bank of Canada, inflation was below two per cent and the dollar was at parity. That is the kind of success I can deliver for this country."Carney said he's an experienced crisis manager who helped Canada get through the Great Recession and the U.K. navigate Brexit — and he can do it again now."I've built strong economies," he said. "And we will build the strongest economy."The debate was much more combative than Wednesday's French-language event.There was more cross-talk and pointed attacks, probably because this is the last match-up of the campaign and millions of people were expected to watch just before advance polls open Friday. The commission's last English debate in 2021 pulled in 10 million viewers.Singh was often leading the assault, accusing Carney of being a Bay Street sellout and saying Poilievre is "disgusting" for how he's described Palestinian aid groups caught up in the Gaza conflict. Blanchet at times struggled in his second language but accused Carney of saying one thing about pipelines in English and another in French.Polls suggest Poilievre is in second place in an election that's shaping up to be a two-man race, and he took his chance to take Carney on — including sparring with the Liberal leader on the issue of crime.Poilievre said the last Liberal government let criminals run wild and violent crime spiral out of control and he is promising to invoke the notwithstanding clause to stop the courts from blocking some of his more aggressive anti-crime measures, including a plan to lock some people up for much longer.Carney said "it's very dangerous" for Poilievre to threaten to override Canadians' Charter rights, saying Poilievre might say it's about punishing hardened criminals but it could be "a slippery slope" with other freedoms potentially under threat."It's not where you start but where will you stop," Carney said.Poilievre said he's more interested in the protecting the Section 7 Charter rights of Canadians to enjoy life, liberty and security of the person — not the rights of convicted criminals."He says its dangerous for me to ensure that mass murderers stay behind bars for life. You know what's dangerous? Turning them loose on our streets," Poilievre said. "People are living in terror."The Carney campaign has sensed crime is a weak spot for the party given past criticism of bail policies — especially in Toronto and the surrounding region. Carney announced some tough-on-crime measures earlier in the campaign and said tonight he supports a crackdown.Under pressure on crime, Carney raised firearms and Poilievre's pledge to dismantle the last government's gun control legislation. "You can't be tough on crime unless you're tough on guns," Carney said.Poilievre also zeroed in on pipelines, saying he will push through oil and gas development to tamp down Canada's dependence on foreign oil — and give Alberta's oil patch access to world markets.He said Carney just isn't pro-pipeline enough because he will keep the past Liberal government's environmental assessment process, which is loathed by some parts of the natural resources sector. He said keeping those regulations "empowers Donald Trump to have a monopoly on our single-biggest export."Blanchet said Quebec won't stand for an oil pipeline running through the province — even though some recent polls show voters there are open to these projects.Blanchet said it doesn't make sense to build pipelines with long construction lead times to take on Trump when he will be out of office in four years' time."Mr. Trump will be 90 years old and not the president," Blanchet said."He might be, he might try," Carney said, prompting a chuckle from Poilievre — a rare moment of levity between the two. Leaders asked what is the biggest security threat to Canada right nowSingh said Poilievre talks a big game about building more homes but his track record under former prime minister Stephen Harper was lacklustre.Pointing to past reporting on Poilievre's time as minister, Singh said Poilievre got very few homes built when housing was part of his cabinet portfolio."It was six homes and that's the facts," Singh said, holding up six fingers. "You can count to six, which is great." Poilievre bristled at the suggestion, saying the number of homes built on his watch was a lot higher than that.Singh said Poilievre's claim that the Liberals are anti-oil is "wild.""The Liberals bought a pipeline and they're pretty pro-pipeline. I don't know what Pierre's complaining about but that's what they did," he said.He said a Conservative government would torch the environment with no rules on development, allowing "big polluters" to run rampant.Poilievre said his climate agenda is all about driving down emissions abroad by exporting more Canadian energy to displace coal used in places like China and India.Main party leaders deliver their pitch to voters at end of English debatePoilievre came down hard on the last Liberal government's track record on immigration, saying the party's leaders let too many people in, which has led to "massive overcrowding in our communities."He promised to get back to "normal levels" of immigration and rid the temporary foreign worker stream of fraud, something the Liberal government has started to do.He said Carney wants to follow "a radical policy" of ever more people coming in to get the country's population to 100 million by the end of the century.Carney didn't get a chance to respond to the accusations but said in last night's French-language debate he supports a cap on immigration to reduce the number of newcomers.Singh pressed Carney on his time at Brookfield Asset Management, a company that has some of its investment funds registered in tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.Singh said Carney spent his time in the private sector looking out for billionaires and can't be trusted to help working people, if elected."Whose side are you really on?" Singh asked at one point, asking voters to return more New Democrats "to force Liberals to worry about people they will forget."Carney defended the company he used to chair, saying it's a "Canadian success story" and one of the largest infrastructure companies in the world, a widely held stock that helps fund pensions for workers like teachers and firefighters."Yes, I have had a long career in the private sector. I'm proud of that career and I've always acted with integrity," Carney said.Singh also pressed Carney on his commitment to do away with the capital gains tax inclusion rate hike that Trudeau first put in place. Carney said he needed to do that now because higher taxes would torpedo economic growth."We need to build this country. Innovators, entrepreneurs need to be rewarded — that's why I brought it back down," Carney said.Senior reporterJ.P.

We've got to get that right."Poilievre returned to the theme of Carney being a Trudeau repeat throughout the debate and, in a particularly dramatic moment, he asked the current Liberal leader at one point to apologize to Canadians for the inflation they experienced in the post-COVID period.Carney said he wasn't in the last government, he briefly served as an economic adviser on a part-time basis and he didn't advise the Liberals to do any of the things that fuelled the cost-of-living crisis. He said he's already cut the last government's carbon tax and he has a plan to build many more homes than they did, which would help with affordability issues."The way you judge someone is how how they act," Carney said. "When I was governor of the Bank of Canada, inflation was below two per cent and the dollar was at parity. That is the kind of success I can deliver for this country."Carney said he's an experienced crisis manager who helped Canada get through the Great Recession and the U.K. navigate Brexit — and he can do it again now."I've built strong economies," he said. "And we will build the strongest economy."The debate was much more combative than Wednesday's French-language event.There was more cross-talk and pointed attacks, probably because this is the last match-up of the campaign and millions of people were expected to watch just before advance polls open Friday. The commission's last English debate in 2021 pulled in 10 million viewers.Singh was often leading the assault, accusing Carney of being a Bay Street sellout and saying Poilievre is "disgusting" for how he's described Palestinian aid groups caught up in the Gaza conflict. Blanchet at times struggled in his second language but accused Carney of saying one thing about pipelines in English and another in French.Polls suggest Poilievre is in second place in an election that's shaping up to be a two-man race, and he took his chance to take Carney on — including sparring with the Liberal leader on the issue of crime.Poilievre said the last Liberal government let criminals run wild and violent crime spiral out of control and he is promising to invoke the notwithstanding clause to stop the courts from blocking some of his more aggressive anti-crime measures, including a plan to lock some people up for much longer.Carney said "it's very dangerous" for Poilievre to threaten to override Canadians' Charter rights, saying Poilievre might say it's about punishing hardened criminals but it could be "a slippery slope" with other freedoms potentially under threat."It's not where you start but where will you stop," Carney said.Poilievre said he's more interested in the protecting the Section 7 Charter rights of Canadians to enjoy life, liberty and security of the person — not the rights of convicted criminals."He says its dangerous for me to ensure that mass murderers stay behind bars for life. You know what's dangerous? Turning them loose on our streets," Poilievre said. "People are living in terror."The Carney campaign has sensed crime is a weak spot for the party given past criticism of bail policies — especially in Toronto and the surrounding region. Carney announced some tough-on-crime measures earlier in the campaign and said tonight he supports a crackdown.Under pressure on crime, Carney raised firearms and Poilievre's pledge to dismantle the last government's gun control legislation. "You can't be tough on crime unless you're tough on guns," Carney said.Poilievre also zeroed in on pipelines, saying he will push through oil and gas development to tamp down Canada's dependence on foreign oil — and give Alberta's oil patch access to world markets.He said Carney just isn't pro-pipeline enough because he will keep the past Liberal government's environmental assessment process, which is loathed by some parts of the natural resources sector. He said keeping those regulations "empowers Donald Trump to have a monopoly on our single-biggest export."Blanchet said Quebec won't stand for an oil pipeline running through the province — even though some recent polls show voters there are open to these projects.Blanchet said it doesn't make sense to build pipelines with long construction lead times to take on Trump when he will be out of office in four years' time."Mr. Trump will be 90 years old and not the president," Blanchet said."He might be, he might try," Carney said, prompting a chuckle from Poilievre — a rare moment of levity between the two. Leaders asked what is the biggest security threat to Canada right nowSingh said Poilievre talks a big game about building more homes but his track record under former prime minister Stephen Harper was lacklustre.Pointing to past reporting on Poilievre's time as minister, Singh said Poilievre got very few homes built when housing was part of his cabinet portfolio."It was six homes and that's the facts," Singh said, holding up six fingers. "You can count to six, which is great." Poilievre bristled at the suggestion, saying the number of homes built on his watch was a lot higher than that.Singh said Poilievre's claim that the Liberals are anti-oil is "wild.""The Liberals bought a pipeline and they're pretty pro-pipeline. I don't know what Pierre's complaining about but that's what they did," he said.He said a Conservative government would torch the environment with no rules on development, allowing "big polluters" to run rampant.Poilievre said his climate agenda is all about driving down emissions abroad by exporting more Canadian energy to displace coal used in places like China and India.Main party leaders deliver their pitch to voters at end of English debatePoilievre came down hard on the last Liberal government's track record on immigration, saying the party's leaders let too many people in, which has led to "massive overcrowding in our communities."He promised to get back to "normal levels" of immigration and rid the temporary foreign worker stream of fraud, something the Liberal government has started to do.He said Carney wants to follow "a radical policy" of ever more people coming in to get the country's population to 100 million by the end of the century.Carney didn't get a chance to respond to the accusations but said in last night's French-language debate he supports a cap on immigration to reduce the number of newcomers.Singh pressed Carney on his time at Brookfield Asset Management, a company that has some of its investment funds registered in tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.Singh said Carney spent his time in the private sector looking out for billionaires and can't be trusted to help working people, if elected."Whose side are you really on?" Singh asked at one point, asking voters to return more New Democrats "to force Liberals to worry about people they will forget."Carney defended the company he used to chair, saying it's a "Canadian success story" and one of the largest infrastructure companies in the world, a widely held stock that helps fund pensions for workers like teachers and firefighters."Yes, I have had a long career in the private sector. I'm proud of that career and I've always acted with integrity," Carney said.Singh also pressed Carney on his commitment to do away with the capital gains tax inclusion rate hike that Trudeau first put in place. Carney said he needed to do that now because higher taxes would torpedo economic growth."We need to build this country. Innovators, entrepreneurs need to be rewarded — that's why I brought it back down," Carney said.Senior reporterJ.P.

He urged voters to make a change.NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was chippy throughout the debate, frequently interrupting Poilievre and Carney as he jockeys to get noticed while polls suggest support for his party has cratered. He spent much of his time trying to paint Carney as an out-of-touch elite who will cut public services.Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet was on a similar message track, accusing Carney of being a corporate bigwig who won't stand up for Quebec's interests.Carney held his own in the face of the onslaught, trying to portray himself as the adult in the room who is best placed to help steer Canada through a period of tremendous upheaval with its once-solid relationship with the U.S. in tatters and the economy on shaky ground."Mark Carney is asking for a fourth Liberal term. Are you prepared to elect the same Liberal MPs, the same Liberal ministers, the same Liberal staffers all over again for a fourth term?" Poilievre said.‘I do my own talking points,’ says Carney Carney took Poilievre on, saying the Conservative leader is trying to paint him as Trudeau 2.0 and it's just not true — he will be laser-focused on the economy and producing results on the issues that matter most to Canadians after years of inaction on some big files."It may be difficult for Mr. Poilievre.

        'news_article': """The New Democratic Party is promising to raise about $94.5 billion by taxing the extremely wealthy, a plan designed to help finance tens of billions in new spending, deliver a tax cut for workers and bolster and expand Canada's health-care system."I'm proud to share our campaign commitments. It's clear. It's bold. And it's focused on the people who build this country," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh as he unveiled the party's platform at a campaign event in Burnaby, B.C., on Saturday morning.The NDP says those commitments will add $48 billion to the federal deficit over the next four years on top of the existing deficit. The party also says $42.2 billion is new spending not offset by revenue.In the fall economic statement, the Liberal government of former prime minister Justin Trudeau projected the deficit in 2025-26 would sit at $42.2 billion. That was projected to drop to $31 billion in 2026-27, $30.4 billion in 2027-28 and $27.8 billion in 2028-29.Singh defends projected deficit increase in NDP platformThe top revenue generator in the NDP platform is a graduated wealth tax.The NDP would implement a one per cent tax on households with a net worth between $10 million and $50 million, two per cent for those worth $50 million to $100 million and three per cent for those over $100 million.According to their platform, that would raise about $94.5 billion in revenue over four years. The party also says they can raise $24.8 billion by closing tax loopholes and another $8 billion by reducing the federal government's use of consultants.That money would help finance a costly part of the NDP platform, which is to raise the basic personal amount — the threshold under which Canadians do not pay tax — to $19,500, along with improving Canada's employment insurance system.Raising the basic personal amount will cost approximately $48.1 billion over four years, according to the NDP platform."No nurse, no teacher, no tradesperson should pay more than a billionaire flipping stocks," Singh said on Saturday.The New Democrats also want to improve Canada's employment insurance system by extending the duration that benefits last to 50 weeks, as well as increasing the benefit level and insurable earnings cap to provide a minimum weekly benefit of $450.That's expected to cost $41 billion over four years. The party says $16 billion would be spent in the next budget year, with the number scaling down over the three following budget years as Canada navigates its ongoing trade war with the United States.The NDP is pledging $46.2 billion in new health-care spending over the next four years.Expanding Canadians' access to health care has been a cornerstone of Singh's campaign. The NDP announced earlier in April they would train more doctors and boost Canada Health Transfers by an extra one per cent to provinces that commit to action.The party's platform says that part of their health-care plan will cost $10 billion over four years.Singh says NDP would ensure every Canadian can access family doctor by 2030The NDP also wants to implement a universal pharmacare program within four years, projecting that will cost approximately $29.2 billion over that time frame.Liberals and New Democrats reach a deal on pharmacareOn Saturday, the NDP also unveiled a new plank of their health-care plan: spending $7 billion over four years to expand mental health coverage so Canadians can better access services like psychotherapy and counselling."We'll make mental health care part of public health care. No more waiting.

        'news_article': """The New Democratic Party is promising to raise about $94.5 billion by taxing the extremely wealthy, a plan designed to help finance tens of billions in new spending, deliver a tax cut for workers and bolster and expand Canada's health-care system."I'm proud to share our campaign commitments. It's clear. It's bold. And it's focused on the people who build this country," said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh as he unveiled the party's platform at a campaign event in Burnaby, B.C., on Saturday morning.The NDP says those commitments will add $48 billion to the federal deficit over the next four years on top of the existing deficit. The party also says $42.2 billion is new spending not offset by revenue.In the fall economic statement, the Liberal government of former prime minister Justin Trudeau projected the deficit in 2025-26 would sit at $42.2 billion. That was projected to drop to $31 billion in 2026-27, $30.4 billion in 2027-28 and $27.8 billion in 2028-29.Singh defends projected deficit increase in NDP platformThe top revenue generator in the NDP platform is a graduated wealth tax.The NDP would implement a one per cent tax on households with a net worth between $10 million and $50 million, two per cent for those worth $50 million to $100 million and three per cent for those over $100 million.According to their platform, that would raise about $94.5 billion in revenue over four years. The party also says they can raise $24.8 billion by closing tax loopholes and another $8 billion by reducing the federal government's use of consultants.That money would help finance a costly part of the NDP platform, which is to raise the basic personal amount — the threshold under which Canadians do not pay tax — to $19,500, along with improving Canada's employment insurance system.Raising the basic personal amount will cost approximately $48.1 billion over four years, according to the NDP platform."No nurse, no teacher, no tradesperson should pay more than a billionaire flipping stocks," Singh said on Saturday.The New Democrats also want to improve Canada's employment insurance system by extending the duration that benefits last to 50 weeks, as well as increasing the benefit level and insurable earnings cap to provide a minimum weekly benefit of $450.That's expected to cost $41 billion over four years. The party says $16 billion would be spent in the next budget year, with the number scaling down over the three following budget years as Canada navigates its ongoing trade war with the United States.The NDP is pledging $46.2 billion in new health-care spending over the next four years.Expanding Canadians' access to health care has been a cornerstone of Singh's campaign. The NDP announced earlier in April they would train more doctors and boost Canada Health Transfers by an extra one per cent to provinces that commit to action.The party's platform says that part of their health-care plan will cost $10 billion over four years.Singh says NDP would ensure every Canadian can access family doctor by 2030The NDP also wants to implement a universal pharmacare program within four years, projecting that will cost approximately $29.2 billion over that time frame.Liberals and New Democrats reach a deal on pharmacareOn Saturday, the NDP also unveiled a new plank of their health-care plan: spending $7 billion over four years to expand mental health coverage so Canadians can better access services like psychotherapy and counselling."We'll make mental health care part of public health care.

She believes that's no longer the case for newcomers to the country.CBC has been asking people across the country about the issues that matter most to them in the April 28, 2025, federal election.While immigration has taken a backseat to concerns like national unity and tariffs, Valamootoo said it's top of mind for her. She wants to hear leaders talk about how they will integrate newcomers into the country."I think the past three years there has been a lot of mistakes by the federal government with regard to how many people they were letting in."She feels that's led to a rise in racism and a backlash against immigrants and international students, who've been blamed for crises in housing and education."I think we need a leader that can bring people together, instead of creating division," she said.As Canada's population has pushed past 41 million people, Canadians and immigrants alike have expressed concern about whether the country has planned enough to incorporate new immigrants into workspaces, schools and homes. The Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association recently commissioned a poll, which found 68 per cent of Saskatchewan people surveyed online supported reducing immigration.Sanjeev Kumar came to Canada on a work permit in 2008 to work in Alberta's restaurant industry and recently opened his own restaurant in northeast Calgary.He's also seen a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment, which he believes is intensified by immigrants being willing to work in minimum wage jobs and creating intense competition for work."Nobody has a job right now. People are struggling. Everyone is struggling. Groceries are so expensive," he said.Kumar said the problem hits international students and other newcomers particularly badly. He has students coming to him, asking for work."They are in college, about to finish, but they don't have money … they don't have food to eat."Kumar said these students and people on work permits also don't have the same clear path to residency that he did when he came to Canada. Kumar got his permanent residency in three years."That time actually, when Harper government was there, I think everything is controlled," he said, adding there needs to be a balance between immigration and integration."Right now there's no balance there. They don't know what they are doing."Since getting his citizenship, Kumar has voted Conservative, but said he's not convinced either of the two main parties have a bold plan to bolster the economy and ensure there's a stronger job market for newcomers and Canadians alike."They are just thinking, small thinking [like] we just take out carbon tax," he said. "They don't have a clear vision for Canada."Ali Abukar, CEO for the Saskatoon Open Door Society, said settlement services like his are among those that help newcomers integrate to Canada with things like employment training and language education. He said the federal government has scaled back money for these organizations as it reduces immigration targets, leading to program cuts at both the Saskatoon and Regina Open Door societies.Reducing immigrant and international student populations can't be done hastily, Abukar said."A lot of the international students have been contributing a lot of money not only to schools and educational institutions, but also businesses and housing," he said. He said immigrants will still be needed to help Canada resolve issues like the labour that's needed to build houses.It speaks to the pressing need for the next elected government to take a phased approach to integrating newcomers into Canada, Abukar said."Our [immigration] numbers didn't become where they are at in just the switch of a light.

        'news_article': """Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre dodged questions Sunday about whether he would repeal the federal government's handgun ban, a measure brought in to tamp down on the diversion of legal firearms into the hands of bad actors.Poilievre hasn't said much during this campaign about what he would do with the Liberal firearms legislation he voted against while in Parliament, but he has blasted the last government's "assault-style" firearm buyback program as a "gun grab" that he would scrap.Gun control advocates say any legislation to curb the flow of firearms is a worthy measure to try and reduce incidents of crime and violence. Firearms rights advocates meanwhile say the Liberal suite of policies only punish lawful gun owners who play by the rules.In 2022, after a spate of violent gun crime and the Nova Scotia massacre, former prime minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet introduced a "freeze" on the sale, purchase and transfer of handguns. The ban was later codified in law with Bill C-21, the government's controversial overhaul of firearms legislation.Asked Sunday what he would do about the handgun ban specifically at a campaign stop in Surrey, B.C., Poilievre said most firearm-related crime is caused by illegal firearms coming up from the U.S. and he questioned whether there is even really a handgun ban in place."Criminals are able to get handguns everywhere they go," Poilievre said. "The problem is illegal guns coming from the United States of America."Poilievre pivoted to his proposal to lock up criminals for longer, including those convicted of firearms offences. Poilievre is proposing life sentences for certain traffickers.Poilievre avoids question about repealing the freeze on handgun sales"The police have said that the current Liberal policies just prevent off-duty police officers and military veterans from practising their craft without going after the criminals who caused the crime," he said.Pressed by reporters if that means the handgun ban would be gone under a government led by him, Poilievre ignored the follow-up and moved on to the next question.Poilievre told a Quebec firearms advocate in January that any firearms ban is "stupid" and he vowed to repeal C-21 — comments he hasn't made in public since then.Liberal Leader Mark Carney has pounced on Poilievre's vague statements about firearms.At the English-language leaders' debate last week, Carney said Poilievre's tough talk about tackling crime is meaningless if he doesn't follow through with a commitment to rein in guns."Every single time there has been a vote in the House of Commons on gun control, Mr. Poilievre has voted against it. You can't be tough on crime unless you're tough on guns," Carney said.PolySeSouvient, a gun control advocacy group, has endorsed the Liberals, saying Carney is the best leader to deliver on its demands to remove "assault-style" firearms from circulation, ban large-capacity magazines and follow through with policies to curb domestic violence.One of the group's founders, Nathalie Provost, is running for the Liberals in Quebec."Saying no to U.S.-style gun laws in Canada — to keep our families and communities safer from gun violence for decades to come — starts at the ballot box," said Heidi Rathjen, a spokesperson for the group that represents the survivors of the Polytechnique massacre.Rathjen called Poilievre a "gun extremist."Some police unions, however, have criticized the Liberal policies as largely ineffective in stopping gun crime.In a statement last fall on the two-year anniversary of the ban becoming law, the Toronto Police Association, the group that represents law enforcement members in that city, said Trudeau's policies were bogus."Whatever you think you've done to improve community safety has not worked," the group said.The Surrey police association said the ban "fails to address the real issue: the surge of illegal firearms coming across our borders and ending up in the hands of violent criminals."CBC News reported in February that the flow of guns over the Canada-U.S. border is a major concern with border data revealing there's been a spike in confiscated guns in recent years.According to Toronto Police Service (TPS) data, the force seized 717 crime guns last year and 88 per cent of those were sourced to the U.S.Of those firearms taken by police in Canada's biggest city, 515 were handguns and 91 per cent of those were traced to the U.S., according to the data.Senior reporterJ.P.

You can't be tough on crime unless you're tough on guns," Carney said.PolySeSouvient, a gun control advocacy group, has endorsed the Liberals, saying Carney is the best leader to deliver on its demands to remove "assault-style" firearms from circulation, ban large-capacity magazines and follow through with policies to curb domestic violence.One of the group's founders, Nathalie Provost, is running for the Liberals in Quebec."Saying no to U.S.-style gun laws in Canada — to keep our families and communities safer from gun violence for decades to come — starts at the ballot box," said Heidi Rathjen, a spokesperson for the group that represents the survivors of the Polytechnique massacre.Rathjen called Poilievre a "gun extremist."Some police unions, however, have criticized the Liberal policies as largely ineffective in stopping gun crime.In a statement last fall on the two-year anniversary of the ban becoming law, the Toronto Police Association, the group that represents law enforcement members in that city, said Trudeau's policies were bogus."Whatever you think you've done to improve community safety has not worked," the group said.The Surrey police association said the ban "fails to address the real issue: the surge of illegal firearms coming across our borders and ending up in the hands of violent criminals."CBC News reported in February that the flow of guns over the Canada-U.S. border is a major concern with border data revealing there's been a spike in confiscated guns in recent years.According to Toronto Police Service (TPS) data, the force seized 717 crime guns last year and 88 per cent of those were sourced to the U.S.Of those firearms taken by police in Canada's biggest city, 515 were handguns and 91 per cent of those were traced to the U.S., according to the data.Senior reporterJ.P.

        'news_article': """U.S. President Donald Trump has been threatening to cancel funding for some universities unless they accede to his demands to change ideological policy, similar to a pledge Pierre Poilievre has made for Canadian post-secondary schools.But so far, the Conservative leader has been sparse on details of exactly what kind of action he might take.Trump's demands, which have sparked condemnation about interference in academic freedom, made headlines this week after the White House said it's freezing more than $2.2 billion US in grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard University.This came after Harvard president Alan Gerber refused to comply with the White House demands, saying in a letter that the university "will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights."Poilievre, meanwhile, has also threatened to defund universities over what he perceives as their ideological slant. In a Christmas Eve tweet on X, formerly known as Twitter, Poilievre said he would "defund wokism and fight antisemitism."That tweet was linked to a telephone interview he gave WinnipegJewishReview.com in which he was quoted as saying he won't tolerate and will defund "all of those with a woke antisemitic agenda," including universities that receive federal funding and all federally funded museums. I will defund wokism and fight antisemitism. <br><br>And stand with our friends in Israel against terror.<a href="https://t.co/hTEdzAPP14">https://t.co/hTEdzAPP14</a>He reiterated a similar pledge on March 26 when the party released its Quebec platform, saying a Conservative government would "put an end to the imposition of woke ideology in the federal civil service and in the allocation of federal funds for university research."The pledge prompted the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) to release a statement "expressing alarm" over Poilievre's promise to interfere in the allocation of federal research funding."It's worrying that a leader of a political party in Canada would try to dictate how research funds will be granted," said David Robinson, CAUT's executive director. "We've seen the impact of this political meddling south of the border where the Trump administration has launched a full-scale assault on universities and the scientific community. This kind of American-style culture war has no place in Canada."Beginning with Columbia University, the Trump administration has rebuked post-secondary institutions across the U.S. over their handling of the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled campuses last year following the 2023 Hamas-led attack inside Israel and the subsequent Israeli attacks on Gaza.Trump has called the protests anti-American and antisemitic, accused universities of peddling Marxism and "radical left" ideology, and promised to end federal grants and contracts to universities that do not agree to his administration's demands.On April 3, the White House issued a list of demands to Harvard that included a ban on face masks, limitations on campus protests and a review of academic departments' biases. About a week later, those demands were expanded to include leadership reforms, changes to admission policy and an end to the university's recognition of certain student organizations.The school's president said Harvard has already made extensive reforms to address antisemitism, but that many of the government's demands don't relate to antisemitism and instead are an attempt to regulate the "intellectual conditions" at Harvard.While Poilievre has not released any details of his proposed plans, he still seems to be taking lessons from the U.S. with threats to defund, said Patrick McCurdy, an associate professor of communication at the University of Ottawa."I would take it seriously in the same way that he has doubled down and is serious about his threats to defund the CBC," McCurdy said. "It's something that people should pay attention to."McCurdy was also part of a research study that examined the evolution of anti-woke discourse in debates within the House of Commons from 2019 to 2023. Their examination of Hansard records revealed that in 2019, there were only two mentions of the word "woke." By 2023, the Conservatives' use of the word had increased to 63 times, with Poilievre responsible for 33 instances that year, their study found.As McCurdy noted in a recent article he co-wrote for Policy Options, the term "woke" is rooted in the African-American experience of racialized violence and originally meant being aware of racial injustice. Progressives then adopted it to encompass broader societal injustices related to feminist, LGBTQ+ and intersectional concerns, he said.But the word has since been co-opted as a derogatory term used against some who promote such social justice concerns, and are accused of being fixated or authoritarian on issues including identity politics and equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) policies.McCurdy's article, titled The many dangers of Pierre Poilievre's war on 'woke,' argues that his policy pledges such as defunding universities over ideology are just "part an exploitative strategy designed to stoke fears and resentment, entrench divisions and legitimize extreme positions in mainstream politics.""I would be interested in reading how he might propose this ... [and] how this militates against the freedom of researchers, academics and universities to do their research," McCurdy told CBC News in a telephone interview. "It's certainly a threat to academic freedom."The Conservatives have spoken in the past about defunding universities over their campus policies. During his leadership campaign in 2017, Andrew Scheer said he would pull federal funding from universities that failed to uphold free speech, "shut down debate and can't stand different points of view."This came in response to instances where anti-abortion and pro-Israel events were turned away from university campuses after protests erupted.Poilievre would later follow up with a similar pledge during his 2022 leadership campaign in which he said if universities want to keep their federal research grants, they'll need to protect academic freedom and guarantee free speech on campus. He also said he would appoint a "free speech guardian" to ensure universities were following those principles.Universities should foster debate, not stifle it. As Prime Minister, I'll defend free speech on campus.<br><br>If universities want to keep their federal research grants, they'll need to protect academic freedom &amp; guarantee free speech on campus.<a href="https://t.co/ontDTk7ieo">https://t.co/ontDTk7ieo</a>As for his current policy pledges, the Conservative Party did not respond to questions from CBC News asking for more details. However, in an interview published April 8 by the English-language media Jewish News Syndicate, Conservative Party candidate Neil Oberman, who is running in the Quebec riding of Mount Royal, said he supports cutting funding to universities that are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on their campuses."[Universities] will not receive a single penny from the federal government until they clean up their act," he said.Stéphane Sérafin, an assistant professor of law at the University of Ottawa who believes that woke ideology is a problem at universities, said the Liberal government has been very aggressive in imposing ideological requirements on research that includes EDI initiatives.But he said he's unsure what exactly Poilievre is contemplating."I would assume that at the very least they'd be looking to remove the kind of EDI requirements that have been added to those research funds. Beyond that, I can only speculate."Sérafin questioned whether a Conservative government would add requirements that comply with their ideological preferences, or if it would simply defund universities."Does he want to defund everything, or does he only want to target specific programs?" Sérafin asked of Poilievre's intentions."He's never kind of explicitly laid out a plan for how this would be done," he said. "It's kind of like one of those issues where the devil really is in the details."Senior ReporterMark Gollom is a Toronto-based reporter with CBC News.
